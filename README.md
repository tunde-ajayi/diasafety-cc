# Overview
DiaSafety-CC is an extension of [DiaSafety](https://github.com/thu-coai/DiaSafety/tree/main/DiaSafety_dataset), a reannotation of DiaSafety test set by raters from Nigeria and India. Raters provide labels as "Safe" or "Unsafe". Also, reasons are provided for the choice of labels as free-form text.<br><br>
The ```/data``` folder contains:<br>
```diasafety_cc.json``` : extended evaluation set<br>
```raters_metadata.json``` : anonymised raters' data

# Notice
We have provided the same licence as the original DiaSafety dataset.

# Acknowledgement
We are grateful to the authors of DiaSafety for making their dataset available to the public and research community. We are also grateful to the raters for their selfless contribution to this work.

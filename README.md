# Overview
DiaSafety-CC is an extension of [DiaSafety](https://github.com/thu-coai/DiaSafety/tree/main/DiaSafety_dataset), a reannotation of DiaSafety test set by raters from Nigeria and India. Raters provide labels as "Safe" or "Unsafe". Also, reasons are provided for the choice of labels as free-form text.<br><br>
The ```/data``` folder contains:<br>
```diasafety_cc.json``` : extended evaluation set<br>
```raters_metadata.json``` : anonymised raters' data

# Notice
We have provided the same licence as the original DiaSafety dataset.
